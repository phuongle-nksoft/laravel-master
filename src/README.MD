```

## Getting Started

`EmailValidator`requires you to decide which (or combination of them) validation/s strategy/ies you'd like to follow for each [validation](#available-validations).

A basic example with the RFC validation

```php
<?php

use Egulias\EmailValidator\EmailValidator;
use Egulias\EmailValidator\Validation\RFCValidation;

$validator = new EmailValidator();
$validator->isValid("example@example.com", new RFCValidation()); //true
```

### Available validations

1. [RFCValidation](https://github.com/egulias/EmailValidator/blob/master/EmailValidator/Validation/RFCValidation.php)
2. [NoRFCWarningsValidation](https://github.com/egulias/EmailValidator/blob/master/EmailValidator/Validation/NoRFCWarningsValidation.php)
3. [DNSCheckValidation](https://github.com/egulias/EmailValidator/blob/master/EmailValidator/Validation/DNSCheckValidation.php)
4. [SpoofCheckValidation](https://github.com/egulias/EmailValidator/blob/master/EmailValidator/Validation/SpoofCheckValidation.php)
5. [MultipleValidationWithAnd](https://github.com/egulias/EmailValidator/blob/master/EmailValidator/Validation/MultipleValidationWithAnd.php)
6. [Your own validation](#how-to-extend)

`MultipleValidationWithAnd`

It is a validation that operates over other validations performing a logical and (&&) over the result of each validation.

```php
<?php

use Egulias\EmailValidator\EmailValidator;
use Egulias\EmailValidator\Validation\DNSCheckValidation;
use Egulias\EmailValidator\Validation\MultipleValidationWithAnd;
use Egulias\EmailValidator\Validation\RFCValidation;

$validator = new EmailValidator();
$multipleValidations = new MultipleValidationWithAnd([
    new RFCValidation(),
    new DNSCheckValidation()
]);
$validator->isValid("example@example.com", $multipleValidations); //true
```

### How to extend

It's easy! You just need to implement [EmailValidation](https://github.com/egulias/EmailValidator/blob/master/EmailValidator/Validation/EmailValidation.php) and you can use your own validation.
